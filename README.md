# NLP
Natural Language Processing tools for Japanese songs, a machine learning project used to find what kind of music it is by their lyrics. 


"FileTranslation" provides translation from Japanese to English.

"GetLyrics/LyricsParser" provides automatically lyrics receiving from websites.

"LIBSVMprocessing" provides the transformation from lyrics to LIBSVM training file format.

"NLP" provides basic language processing functions, like stemming and lemmatization.

"XMLprocessing" directly reads XML files, turning into LIBSVM training file format.
